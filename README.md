Foundry makes creating fixtures data fun again, via an expressive, auto-completable, on-demand fixtures system with
Symfony and Doctrine:

```php
$post = PostFactory::new() // Create the factory for Post objects
    ->published()          // Make the post in a "published" state
    ->create([             // create & persist the Post object
        'slug' => 'post-a' // This Post object only requires the slug field - all other fields are random data
    ])
;
```

The factories can be used inside [DoctrineFixturesBundle](https://symfony.com/bundles/DoctrineFixturesBundle/current/index.html)
to load fixtures or inside your tests, [where it has even more features](https://symfony.com/bundles/ZenstruckFoundryBundle/current/index.html#using-in-your-tests).

Foundry supports `doctrine/orm` (with [doctrine/doctrine-bundle](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrinebundle)),
`doctrine/mongodb-odm` (with [doctrine/mongodb-odm-bundle](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineMongoDBBundle))
or a combination of these.

## Credit

The [AAA](https://www.thephilocoder.com/unit-testing-aaa-pattern/) style of testing was first introduced to me by
[Adam Wathan's](https://adamwathan.me/) excellent [Test Driven Laravel Course](https://course.testdrivenlaravel.com/).
The inspiration for this libraries API comes from [Laravel factories](https://laravel.com/docs/master/database-testing)
and [christophrumpel/laravel-factories-reloaded](https://github.com/christophrumpel/laravel-factories-reloaded).
